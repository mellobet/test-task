    #   find man:
    #    -exec command {} +
    #           This  variant  of  the  -exec action runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command line is
    #           built by appending each selected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of the command will  be
    #           much  less than the number of matched files.  The command line is built in much the same way that xargs builds
    #           its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the command, and (when find is  being  invoked
    #           from  a  shell) it should be quoted (for example, '{}') to protect it from interpretation by shells.  The com‚Äê
    #           mand is executed in the starting directory.  If any invocation returns a non-zero value as exit  status,  then
    #           find returns a non-zero exit status.  If find encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit,
    #           so some pending commands may not be run at all.  This variant of -exec always returns true.

    #   sort man
    #          -h, --human-numeric-sort
    #   compare human readable numbers (e.g., 2K 1G)


Oneliners: 
sudo find / -type f -exec  du -Sh {} + | sort -hr | head -n 3

# Without /proc
sudo find / -type f -not -path "/proc/*" -exec du -Sh {} + | sort -hr | head -n 3
